The program will show planes for the MTG format. To change between planes randomly click on the "Planeswalk" button. If you want to select a specific plane click on the "Viajar a destino" button, this grants access to another panel where you can look for the plane you want, or write the name of a specific one.
The right side is a HP counter, with two buttons on top which allows to instan set all HP counters to 20 or 40 depending on the type of game is playing (standar or commander).

This is one of my first programs, so the structure is not the best, and will probably undergo several changes in the future.
